# Useful Templates
Here are some useful templates for files I commonly setup in R. These files require installation of the ```Rmarkdown``` and ```knitr``` packages. 

* ```knitting_options_template.R``` - This file specifies knitting options to create reports from the various .R files in this directory. 
* ```R_analyses_template_spin_ready``` - this is a basic R template. Ready to have code added to it and setup to be turned into a report using ```spin``` and ```knitr```.
* ```Multireport``` - this directory contains multiple .R files that can be strung together into a final concatenated report.
